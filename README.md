# vim-config
This is my heavily optimized configuration for Vim.
I prefer the included theme https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim but it can be used with whatever theme you like.

Please note that `t_Co=256` requires that your terminal supports 256 colors.
You might need to set your `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color`.

jellybeans.vim goes into ~/.vim/colors/
