# vim-config
This is my heavily optimized configuration for Vim.

## Requirements
**jellybeans theme**

I use the theme https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim but it can be used with whatever theme you like. Please note that `t_Co=256` requires that your terminal supports 256 colors. You might need to set your `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color`. jellybeans.vim goes into `~/.vim/colors/`


**vim-airline plugin**
